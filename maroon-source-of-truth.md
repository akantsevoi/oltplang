- keeps
    - k-v objects
        - k - key of the object
        - v 
            - hash(last n versions)
            - type
                - name
                - supported type versions
            - version
            - log of transformations between different object's versions
    - indexes (for quicker finding the right objects. Ex: which repository to ask)
- lives on maroon-nodes
    - to quicker query
    - quicker perform validations: which code we can/can't deploy depends on the types

- [!] There is difference between type version and object version
    - [TODO:?] do we need to keep type version for each object? Or it will be  enough to know what's the current active type?
        - looks like we need. We can use this information to allow active-type switching
